# AllanPoe: technophile poet
# EAPbot is a twitterbot that uses a simple Markov model to generate short messages.
# The text generated by the bot comes from a couple major sources. 
# First, whatever main articles are on the http://gizmodo.com site are the first source of text.
# Second, the text of Allan Poe's The Tell Tale Heart and The Raven provide the poetic elements that may appear in any of the gibberish generated by the bot.
