# AllanPoe: technophile poet
EAPbot is a twitterbot that uses a simple Markov model to generate short messages.
The text generated by the bot comes from a couple major sources. 
First, whatever main articles are on the http://gizmodo.com site are the first source of text.
Second, the text of Allan Poe's The Tell Tale Heart and The Raven provide the poetic elements that may appear in any of the gibberish generated by the bot.
